## Milk Edition!

- Milk (added on Fabric / enabled on NeoForge)
    - Milk is technically placeable, but milk bucket does not place milk
    - To actually have flowing milk, you'll need to use the /replace command or install another mod that can place fluids
- Cows standing on a fluid hopper will be automatically milked
- Bottles can be filled with milk directly from a hopper or with a dispenser
    - Milk bottles are consumable just like milk buckets
    - You still need a bucket to milk a cow. Trying to milk a cow into a bottle sounds difficult and unpleasant.

## Other changes
* Fixed invisible water in cauldron (Fabric)
* Cauldron can be filled by rain (water) or dripstone (water or lava)
